# Brandon Resume Bot - Design Document

## Project Overview
An AI-powered resume bot that allows potential employers to interact with Brandon's professional background through a natural language chat interface. The bot uses OpenAI's GPT models to provide accurate, context-aware responses about work experience, skills, and projects.

## Deployment Platform: Hugging Face Spaces
- **URL Structure**: `https://huggingface.co/spaces/brandon/resume-bot`
- **Framework**: Gradio (native HF Spaces support)
- **Runtime**: Python 3.9+
- **Storage**: Built-in document storage in repository

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Document Processing (`document_processor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Parse and process resume/portfolio documents
- **Features**:
  - PDF text extraction
  - Markdown parsing
  - Text chunking for context windows
  - Document embedding generation
- **Libraries**: PyPDF2, python-docx, sentence-transformers

#### 2. Bot Engine (`bot.py`)
- **Purpose**: Core AI logic and response generation
- **Features**:
  - OpenAI API integration
  - Context-aware prompt engineering
  - Response filtering and validation
  - Conversation memory management
- **Models**: GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4 (configurable)

#### 3. Chat Interface (`chat_interface.py`)
- **Purpose**: Gradio UI components and interaction flow
- **Features**:
  - Professional chat interface
  - File upload capabilities
  - Conversation history
  - Export chat logs
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for professional appearance

#### 4. Configuration (`config.py`)
- **Purpose**: Environment variables and settings
- **Features**:
  - API key management (HF Secrets)
  - Model selection
  - Response parameters
  - Rate limiting

## Features

### Primary Features
1. **Natural Language Q&A**: Answer questions about work experience, skills, projects
2. **Document-Aware Responses**: Contextual answers based on uploaded resume/portfolio
3. **Professional Interface**: Clean, employer-friendly chat interface
4. **Conversation Memory**: Maintain context throughout the conversation
5. **Response Validation**: Ensure responses stay professional and relevant

### Advanced Features
1. **Multi-Document Support**: Handle resume, cover letters, portfolio docs
2. **Export Conversations**: Allow employers to save chat logs
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse while maintaining accessibility
4. **Analytics**: Track popular questions (privacy-compliant)

## Technical Implementation

### OpenAI Integration
```python
# System prompt engineering
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are Brandon's professional AI assistant. You have access to his resume and work history.
Respond professionally and accurately about his background, skills, and experience.
Always stay in character as a helpful assistant representing Brandon to potential employers.
"""
```

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **Ingestion**: Load resume/documents at startup
2. **Parsing**: Extract text and structure
3. **Chunking**: Split into manageable pieces
4. **Embedding**: Generate vector representations
5. **Indexing**: Create searchable knowledge base

### HF Spaces Deployment Configuration

#### `app.py` (Entry Point)
```python
import gradio as gr
from src.brandon_bot.chat_interface import create_interface

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo = create_interface()
    demo.launch()
```

#### `requirements.txt`
```
gradio>=4.0.0
openai>=1.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
PyPDF2>=3.0.0
sentence-transformers>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.21.0
```

#### Environment Variables (HF Secrets)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API access
- `BOT_NAME`: Customizable bot name
- `MAX_TOKENS`: Response length limit

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- No conversation storage on servers
- API keys secured in HF Secrets
- No personal data collection from users

### Rate Limiting
- Implement conversation limits per session
- API usage monitoring
- Graceful degradation for high traffic
